focus on back end development.

Students see the same views (with some exceptions) but cannot
upload/delete work, and instead of a class list they see the teachers
information.

# Description

This is the copy of my IMS thesis assignment that was submitted and, in
terms of back-end development, is what I am most proud of to date. This
was my first major project that I took on by myself. With the help of
teachers and a lot of research and learning on my own time I was able
to finish what I said I would do and complete the goals I set up for
myself earlier than I could have anticipated.

# Features:

Access as student or teacher, teachers can upload assignments and
forms, and select due dates for both, can check off students completed
work and leave feedback, can create units in courses and upload work to
these units, etc.

Student Upload is not complete, only there for demonstration purposes, this is currently the only function not available in the application
